      "Top 5 Tennis Drills For ALL Levels - Top Tennis Training\n",
      "The tennis drills you use on a consistent basis will either help or hinder your improvements. That's why it's so important to have focused and structured practice sessions. Download our FREE tennis guides here - https://www.top-tennis-training.com/free-guide/\n",
      "In this free tennis lesson, Top Tennis Training coaches Simon and Alex will show you our top five tennis drills for players of all levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Drill One - Depth consistency. In this baseline drill, the focus is on maintaining good length when rallying from the baseline. The goal is to hit 20 balls in a row between the service and baselines. If either player hits the ball out or in the service boxes, start from zero and try again. Some players will struggle to reach 20 to begin, so you could always start with 10 and progress from there. More advanced players may want to test themselves by aiming for 30, 40 or even 50 balls in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drill Two - Working the weakness. When it comes to weaknesses in tennis, most players will have a stronger forehand and weaker backhand. In this baseline drill, the focus is all about exposing the weakness for player A (Alex) and improving the weakness for player B (Simon).\n",
      "Player A has to aim into the backhand wing of player B and maintain the ball on that half of the court. Player B can hit anywhere but should only hit backhands. Player B can mix up play by using heavy topspin, slices or flatter shots and changing direction often. \n",
      "Make sure to have a go at both roles in this drill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drill Three - Baseline precision. In this baseline drill, the focus is on being precise with the down the line shot from the baseline. The goal is to hit 10 balls in a row, within the tramlines (doubles alley). If either player misses, reset the tally and start again whilst continuing the rally if possible. Do this on both the forehand and backhand sides. Work hard with your feet to get in the right position and recover slightly so you can keep hitting off one wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drill Four - Volley precision and consistency. In this net drill, the focus is on maintaining short, compact swings on your volleys and maintaining a certain direction with your volleys. You can do this as an open drill, hitting both forehand and backhand volleys or you can close it off to crosscourt only. In our demonstration, we are hitting forehand volleys crosscourt, followed by backhand volleys crosscourt. See how many volleys you can make in a row, a good target to aim for is 40 balls in total (20 each).\n",
      "\n",
      "Drill Five - When it comes to attacking the net in tennis, many tennis players struggle with being lobbed. In this net drill, the focus is on getting back to cover the lob and then closing down on the net.\n",
      "The net player starts midway in the service boxes, hitting one volley and one smash. Player A (net) aims all their shots back into one half of the court and player B (baseline) mixes up the feeds. \n",
      "See how many balls you can make in a row and swap roles.\n",
