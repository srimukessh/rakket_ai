High Performance Tennis Drills  for kids with Coach Brian Dabul,Not Implemented,,,,,,,,PT36S,,,
High Intensity Tennis Drills for Advanced Players | High Performance Tennis Drills | Supreme Tennis,Not Implemented,,,,,,,,PT5M9S,"In this practice session, we look at several different performance tennis drills that you can use to elevate your game. Whilst carrying out these drills, you can work on certain technical aspects to your strokes as well as different tactical situations you may find yourselves in when competing.

Drill 1. Side to sides. Run around every other backhand. When playing a match look to dictate with your forehand as often as possible.

Drill 2. Feeds from behind. Stay with the ball and lean into the shot. This drill encourages proper weight transfer.

Drill 3. Accelerations. Good for building racquet head speed.

Drill 4. Finishing ball (forehand and backhand). It is easy to get carried away on the ‘easy put away ball’. Watch the ball as well as you would any other shot and do not let the ball drop too low if you want to flatten the shot out.

Drill 5. Finishing ball (forehand only). Again, when the opportunity presents itself, look to use your forehand.

Drill 6. Angled forehand. Stay low and aim for thin contact.

Drill 7. Angled backhand. Use your top hand to brush up the back of the ball to get that thin contact and more spin.

Drill 8. Creating space. The wider you are, the sharper the angle you can find.

Drill 9. Slice and kill. Use the slice to change the pace of the rally and sometimes even earn the short ball.
